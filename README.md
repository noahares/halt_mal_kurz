# WIP: Halt Mal Kurz Corona Edition

In an effort to play card games with my friends in times of social distancing I started this porject to be able to play [Halt Mal Kurz](http://www.halt-mal-kurz.de/) via the web.
This Project is based on Nodejs and Phaser. It uses an Express server and socket.io to communicate between the server and clients.

## Installation

Simply clone this porject and run
```
npm install
```
in the project root directory.
Afterwards
```
npm run start
``` 
in the root directory and the client directory to start everything up on your localhost.
The game should be available at localhost:8080
